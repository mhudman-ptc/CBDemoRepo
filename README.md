Sample Java code to demonstrate CB integration with:
- SCM (GitHub, GitLab, Git, SVN, etc.)
- Pipelines (Jenkins, Azure DevOps, etc.)
- Automated testing (xUnit)

The code is a simple "Hello World" Java application that can be built and 
tested with Maven. It demonstrates the ability to automate the process of
uploading test results to CB.
